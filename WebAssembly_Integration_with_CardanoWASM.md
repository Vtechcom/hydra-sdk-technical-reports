# WebAssembly Integration with CardanoWASM

## Overview
WebAssembly (WASM) provides a portable and efficient way to run compiled code in various environments, including web browsers and Node.js. CardanoWASM is the WebAssembly build of the Cardano Serialization Library, enabling developers to interact with Cardano blockchain data, transactions, and cryptography directly from JavaScript or TypeScript environments.

## Key Benefits
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs in browsers, Node.js, and serverless environments.
- **Performance**: Near-native execution speed for cryptographic operations.
- **Interoperability**: Seamless integration with frontend and backend JavaScript applications.

## Typical Use Cases
1. Building lightweight Cardano wallets in browsers.
2. Verifying transactions client-side without exposing private keys.
3. Integrating Cardano functionality into decentralized applications (dApps).
4. Running cryptographic validation in serverless functions.

## Example Integration
```javascript
import init, { Address } from '@emurgo/cardano-serialization-lib-browser';

async function loadWasm() {
    await init();
    const address = Address.from_bech32("addr1...");
    console.log(address.to_bytes());
}

loadWasm();
```

## Best Practices
- Use the browser-specific build (`-browser`) for web apps to reduce bundle size.
- Avoid blocking the UI thread by performing heavy operations in Web Workers.
- Always validate WASM initialization before calling methods.
